# [ISS-234] brew link openssl --force is not longer respected

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-234.xml)
<p><p>The latest version of home brew will no longer link openssl even when using the --force command:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/597" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/597</a></p>

<p>I was able to make perfect build on the mac by manually creating all the symlinks but it was tedious and error prone.</p>

<p>Is there a way we can have perfect check the normal place for openssl and if not there, fallback to the /usr/local/Cellar location that home-brew installs openssl into?</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Jeffrey Bergier,</p>

<p>This issue is caused by Homebrew.<br/>
Please try the new OpenSSL package, it contains a complete C dependancy that avoids Homebrew.</p>
