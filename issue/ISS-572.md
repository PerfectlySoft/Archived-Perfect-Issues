<p>Currently, you can try Perfect-LocalAuthentication, and please also follow up because Perfect may have more incoming features about authentication soon.</p>

<p><p>Thanks for the info!  I had heard about the Stormpath/Okta transition in terms of services, but wasn't clear on its impact to package support.  I will look into migrating my web service to use the LocalAuthentication component.  Cheers!</p></p>
