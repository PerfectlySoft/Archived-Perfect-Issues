<p><p>I've seen some of the progress in getting Swift on ARM, but to my knowledge, Perfect has not been tested against that deployment. I saw someone was having some success, at least made it far enough to report some bugs, installing on a Backbone device using Swift on ARM.</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dvdblk" class="user-hover" rel="dvdblk">David Bielik</a> I've been looking into Perfect on ARM devices. Last I attempted a few days ago, there was an issue (<a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/browse/ISS-202" title="PerfectNet integer type issues" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="ISS-202">ISS-202</a>) with some Integer types in Perfect-Net.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi2 and Beaglebone Black are both armv7 devices, which are "supported" to some degree (compiler, Foundation, Package Manager work; repl is broken, tests are ignored)<br/>
Raspberry Pi3 (armv8) is not well supported for now, but you can do some things with it. Last I tried SPM had some issues. </p>

<p>At this point, Swift on armv7 devices should be good enough to work with Perfect and other similar projects.</p>

<p>If you need more information, you can check out <a href="http://dev.iachieved.it/iachievedit/swift-for-arm-systems/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Joe Bell's post</a> about Swift 3 on ARM.</p></p>
