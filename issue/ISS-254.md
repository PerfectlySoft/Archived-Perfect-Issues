# [ISS-254] Please pin your dependencies to specific versions

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-254.xml)
<p><p>With all of the Swift versions / etc, I need to make sure that whatever I build using Perfect will continue to compile as time moves on. When building Turnstile's Perfect integration, I'm using Pefect-HTTP 0.26. However, I noticed that all of the underlying dependencies are not pinned, meaning that the builds will be inconsistent and will probably fail in the future because a underlying dependency gets updated to a newer version of Swift.</p>

<p>For external components, this makes it very hard to build something that always works for an end user. I'd like to ask that the Perfect team pins internal dependencies to specific versions, so I can build something that works, and deliver predictable updates. </p></p>

<p><p>Hi Edward Jiang,</p>

<p>When we started working on P 2.0 we were pinning all the Package.swift versions as you describe. This became very unwieldy as things were progressing so rapidly and having to go and update dozens of package files for each tag was quite cumbersome. Because this is a beta period both for Swift 3.0 and for Perfect 2.0 we do not want people to be fixed on specific old/past versions of the components (or language) and would rather everyone stay up to date with the latest versions.</p>

<p>That said, as soon as Swift 3.0 is final we will immediately go through all the repos and pin all the package files to P 2.0.0 and tag everything likewise.</p>

<p><p>Cool &#8211; just letting you know that it does make it harder to build something against Perfect's beta versions. Definitely understand that it makes it more challenging for your team, though don't you go through tagging each version anyways, so SPM can pull it? </p></p>

<p><p>Yes you have to tag the individual version but you don't have to go and update anything else that depends on it when you use the...range.</p>

<p><p>We've tagged and pinned everything to 2.0.x.</p></p>
