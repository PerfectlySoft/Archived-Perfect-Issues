# [ISS-241] MIssing module libpq

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-241.xml)
<p><p>Hello,</p>

<p>I am trying to build a project in Xcode with the PostgreSQL connector. I added it to my Package.swift file. The project compiles in the command line with swift build just fine, but if I try to compile with Xcode it says 'No such module libpq.' I checked the reference in module.modulemap and the path is correct, and the required libpq-fe.h is symlinked there. Is there any reason why Xcode is not finding the file? Thanks! </p></p>

<p><p>Hi Kurt Bitner,</p>

<p>I suggest regenerating your Xcode project, performing a clean, and try building again.</p>

<p>Let me know if this resolves the issue please!</p>
