# [ISS-140] Refactoring: Investigate Use of external template engine

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-140.xml)
<p><p>I suggest that the template engine should be decoupled from the framework. We can use a default template engine, loading it as a submodule. That way a developer will have the ability to use the template engine of her choice with a little configuration.</p>

<p>I would prefer depending on an external template engine. <a href="https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">GRMustache</a> appears that is closer to our own mustache template engine and it would be a good replacement candidate.</p>

<p>I also feel that the following features should investigated:</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>[ ] Route gluing a Handler/Controller? with a Template</li>
	<li>[ ] template extensions</li>
	<li>[ ] template partial support</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><p>Thanks @alexandros-s - we have in fact done the migration to using Swift 3 &amp; Swift Package Manager.<br/>
Using SPM allows exactly what you wish, as we have decoupled things like Mustache to their own modules.</p></p>
