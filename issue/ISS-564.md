# [ISS-564] PerfectAssistant - empty "Tasks" window

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-564.xml)
<p><p>Hi team perfect,</p>

<p>I have on several occations experienced that the "Tasks" window stays empty. </p>

<p>No matter what I do no content appears in the window. I have tried rebooting. IMHO, something is wrong if the window stays empty like this. The very least the app should show a status message indicating that everything is good. In case something is wrong, then it should show a path to the log file, so that I can look in the logfile myself.</p>

<p>I have been away from Perfect Assistant for around 10 days. During time I have upgraded macOS, because of a severe root exploit that Apple have fixed. 10 days ago everything worked smoothly. Now I can't get anything shown in the "tasks" window.</p>

<p>My setup is:<br/>
macOS Sierra 10.12.6.. I have not yet upgraded to High Sierra<br/>
Xcode 9.0.1 (9A1004).. I have not yet upgraded to Xcode9.2</p></p>

<p><p>Things I have tried unsuccesful:</p>
<ul>
	<li>rebooting</li>
	<li>deleting `DerivedData`</li>
	<li>creating a new project based on the `Perfect Template App`</li>
	<li>Update Docker image</li>
	<li>Delete `org.perfectlysoft.PerfectAssistant2.plist`</li>
	<li>Delete `.build`</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally I deleted these files: `PADockerfile_build`, `PADockerfile_deploy`.<br/>
Now I again can see messages in the `tasks` window.</p>
