# [ISS-565] class Config on PostgresStORM doesn't work with Swift 4

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-565.xml)
<p><p>when building an app based on PerfectServers/Perfect-Authentication-Server and got stuck - the server could not connect to the PostgreSQL server.</p>

<p>So I debugged it and figured it out that line #87 of Config.swift is trying to load </p>

<p>PostgresConnector in its superclass extension PostgresStORM:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/PerfectServers/Perfect-Authentication-Server/blob/master/Sources/PerfectAuthServer/configuration/Config.swift#L87" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectServers/Perfect-Authentication-Server/blob/master/Sources/PerfectAuthServer/configuration/Config.swift#L87</a></p>

<p>I believe that in Swift 3 it could be done but unfortunately, Swift 4 is no longer supporting such a call.</p>

<p>This hypothesis has been proved by replacing `thisConfig.sql` to `thisConfig.exec` with turning `exec` from internal to public. After the patch, the server can run well.</p>

<p>So please re-design all these singleton usages if it had been applied to other libraries.</p>
