# [ISS-159] FireFox can't connect to Perfect WebSocket Server.

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-159.xml)
<p><p>FireFox can't connect to Perfect WebSocket Server. Tested Firefox Version is 45.0.1, other version might be the same.<br/>
Because Firefox send the request with <tt>Connection</tt> header <tt>keep-alive, Upgrade</tt>, not as the <tt>WebSocketHandler.swift</tt> #292 line exactly checked <tt>Upgrade</tt>.</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
where upgrade.lowercaseString == <span class="code-quote">"websocket"</span> &amp;&amp; connection.lowercaseString == <span class="code-quote">"upgrade"</span> <span class="code-keyword">else</span> {
... ...
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>But,<br/>
The RFC-6455 spec, Section 4.1 states ...</p>

<p>   6.   The request MUST contain a |Connection| header field whose value<br/>
        MUST <b>include</b> the "Upgrade" token.</p>

<p>which means that multi-value Connection header is legitimate and needs to be handled properly.<br/>
so, FireFox actions right.</p></p>

<p><p>Thank you! I'm going to target fixing this for 1.1 and will backport it to a new 1.0.1 branch. I'll close this when completed.</p></p>
