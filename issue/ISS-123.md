# [ISS-123] Feature request: AWS Lambda support

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-123.xml)
<p><p>Not sure what AWS would need to do to make Swift/Perfect available for Lambda development, but I'd love to see this availability.  I would imagine Swift/Perfect already would be usable from EC2.</p></p>

<p><p>It is relatively straight forward to run on AWS via Docker and ECS.</p></p>

<p><p>@vince-marco <em>*<b>"I would imagine Swift/Perfect already would be usable from EC2"</b>*</em><br/>
That's great news. Do you have a gist that goes through the steps? It might be trivial but still useful.</p>

<p>As for Docker, I tried them with Google Containers and they were always failing. Whereas with Amazon EC2 and Ubuntu (Trusty) 14.04 LTS, you can pass ssh -o "ServerAliveInterval 10" when connecting and it will not timeout.</p>

<p>Looking forward to a straightforward setup gist for AWS EC2 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.</p></p>

<p>vince-marco: Hello. If you log into the Amazon EC2 Console<span class="error">&#91;1&#93;</span>, the us-east-1 region has a public perfect-ubuntu-1510 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from owner 106004027494. Does this information help you?</p>

<p>loopbum: Hello.  Have you tried the PerfectlySoft Inc. Ubuntu 15.10 Perfect Docker image? It can be found here<span class="error">&#91;2&#93;</span>.</p>

<p><p>loopbum: I'm afraid that I've misunderstood what it is that you're interested in.  Sorry about that.  I don't know what a "setup gist" is.</p></p>

<p><p>loopbum: Yes, I know what a "gist" is, here on GitHub.  Getting Swift and Perfect to be available in your own system will depend on your operating system and its version.  In general, the steps are:</p>
<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>Extract the right Swift download into the filesystem</li>
	<li>Put the Perfect git repository somewhere, perhaps as a /usr/src/perfect/ directory</li>
	<li>In the Perfect PerfectLib/ directory, read the Linux build notes in the read-me file and run 'make' and 'make install'</li>
	<li>In the Perfect PerfectServer/ directory, read the Linux build notes in the read-me file and run 'make' and 'make install'</li>
	<li>In the Perfect Connectors/ directory, for each module's directory, read the Linux build notes in the read-me file and run 'make', then copy the resulting file.so and file.swiftmodule into somewhere useful, perhaps into the /usr/local/lib/ directory</li>
</ul>


<p>Only Ubuntu is considered for the Linux build notes, but Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS should have counterparts.</p></p>

<p><p>I agree with the comments.  Perfect is not needed for implementing AWS Lamdbas.  API Gateway handles all REST request/response interaction.  The JS bootstrapping is a bit hokey, but that is on AWS and cannot be resolved through Perfect.</p></p>
