<p><p>The following URL returns no results. My take is that the project is not open to the public nor to signed up users.</p>

<p><a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/projects/ISS/issues" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://jira.perfect.org:8080/projects/ISS/issues</a></p>

<p>Url was found here: <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis</a></p>

<p>Despite that url, sign in up on JIRA provides no access to any list of open issues.</p></p>

<p><p>Seems like currently users can only access their own submitted issues which prevents any type of collaboration.</p>

<p>Issues should be publicly accessible, indexable by Google and any signed up user should be able to comment on them.</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Eneko Alonso,</p>

<p>For some reason the addition of new users to the Jira-Service-Desk group was not happening. This has now been resolved.<br/>
Thanks for bringing this to our attention Eneko!</p>

<p><p>Hi Jonathan,</p>

<p>I just logged back in and still can only see my issues (this one). I'm sure there are other open/closed issues.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
Eneko</p></p>

<p><p>Never mind, that applies only to the Service Desk url: <a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/servicedesk/customer/portal/1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://jira.perfect.org:8080/servicedesk/customer/portal/1</a></p>

<p>A bit confusing, I would say. Not sure the service desk is worth it, if users must log in to submit issues/requests, why not have them do it directly on the JIRA project?</p></p>
