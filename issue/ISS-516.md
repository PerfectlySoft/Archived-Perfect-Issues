# [ISS-516] StORM (Postgres) Cannot save/update optional/nil values

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-516.xml)
<p><p>I have several properties on my model class that are optional, to be consistent with the Postgres table. The default behavior of PG StORM is to create text fields in PG on setup(), and at least null values are passed as empty strings. You run into issues when you have something like </p>

<p><tt>var score: Int?</tt></p>

<p>That needs to be saved/updated. It's possible to create a new record, but updating is impossible if you wish to then remove that value from <tt>score</tt>.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know if there needs to be some kind of <tt>Null</tt> type that gets converted right at db.exec, or something else, but the problem I see is that The full PGStORM stack is expecting non-optional values of the correct type. The <tt>exec(statement, params)</tt> function in PostGresStORM.swift requires the params to be non-optional <tt>String</tt>, though the actual PGConnection.exec will take <tt>params: <span class="error">&#91;Any?&#93;</span></tt></p>

<p>If I were to pass an <em>empty string</em> into <tt>update()</tt> (because I have no other choice but to pass a non-optional value and an empty string is the closest you get), Postgres will emit an error such as this: <tt><span class="error">&#91;INFO&#93;</span> Error msg: ERROR:  invalid input syntax for integer: ""</tt>. </p>

<p>You can test this by using an existing PG StORM model and adding an additional optional type property, and see how it behaves on various CRUD actions.</p></p>

<p><p>As it stands, this issue is a blocker for me. I feel like this is a pretty critical piece of missing functionality, given Swift's use of optionals. My data model does not lend well to using default values in some of these properties - they are null for a reason.</p></p>
