# [ISS-579] PerfectAssistant - print Xcode/swift version

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-579.xml)
<p><p>When I have compile errors, then I'm confused about which version of swift/Xcode is being used by PerfectAssistant.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I'm confused what version is installed on linux. I could do a SSH and check, but I'm lazy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I have multiple Xcode versions installed on my machine, because I have several projects, that aren't running the newest version of Xcode. I could get rid of older Xcode versions, but then I wouldn't be able to work on client projects.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Solution: Print out Xcode/swift version details before compiling. This makes it possible to reason about what went wrong. Much better user experience.</p></p>
