# [ISS-226] Autocompletion doesn't work with Xcode 8

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-226.xml)
<p><p>I'm using snapshot(16.06.20) version of swift via toolchain in Xcode 8.</p>

<p>I have some code syntax highlighting, but can't use "command+mouse left click" (go to declaration), "alt+mouse left click" have same behaviour ("No Quick Help").</p>

<p>Have I write all code by the hand? Without autocompletion?</p>

<p>Project compiles (console output):</p>

<p>    <span class="error">&#91;INFO&#93;</span> Starting HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:8181 with document root ./webroot</p>

<p>And also run successful on DigitalOcean server(host).</p></p>

<p><p>Sounds like an xcode bug.</p>

<p>Close the xcode window, then quit xcode - it will probably work when you restart it.</p>

<p>If it doesn't, check activity monitor for xcode related services (my sourcekit on xcode 8 leaks memory) and quit those (then restart xcode again)</p></p>

<p><p>You may have to build at least once before it can autocomplete as well</p></p>

<p><p>Yes, needs to be built at least once for autocomplete to work in Xcode.<br/>
Else it's an Xcode bug, not a Perfect issue sorry!</p></p>
