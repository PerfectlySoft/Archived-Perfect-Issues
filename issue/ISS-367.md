<p><p>I tried to stress pushing the requests to the extreme with 100K connections, it throws "Illegal Instruction: 4" in macOS terminal/console and have not tested with that amount of load testing. I believe it applicable for Kitura which it has happened in the earlier version few months ago but have not tried with the latest version</p>

<p>macOS 10.12, 8GB Memory RAM, has unused 500MB memory.<br/>

<p>Using project for the test, compiled with release mode and commented logging display printed on the console:<br/>

<p><p>The error only happen once in a rare situation, if Perfect could be resilient and robust by auto restarting itself if the process was terminated by known error?</p></p>

<p><p>Sorry, I have found the error was caused by improper database configuration that lead to crash. Nothing to do with the system load.</p></p>
