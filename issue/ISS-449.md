# [ISS-449] Deploy to linux with servers running on port 8080 & 8181 

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-449.xml)
<p><p>Starting from the PrefectTemplate project (with modifications so different endpoints are available on each server (port) and using the assistant to deploy to linux (EC2)</p>

<p>The deployment succeeds but only port 8080 is connected to a server and usable.</p>

<p>How do you tell the assistant that both ports should be connected / available?</p>

<p>There should be some configuration in the assistant tool if some build time setting / linux service runtime config is required for this.</p></p>

<p><p>As a side note, for anyone looking at this issue, i 'fixed' the issue for myself by modifying the file `Perfect Assistant.app/Contents/Resources/buildlinux` so the run command is:</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
RES=`docker run \
-v <span class="code-quote">"${PROJECT_DIR}:/perfectbuild"</span> \
-v <span class="code-quote">"${PROJECT_DIR}/.packages_lin:/perfectbuild/Packages"</span> \
-w /perfectbuild \
--rm \
-p 8080:8080 -p 8181:8181 \
-t \
<span class="code-quote">"${IMAGE_NAME}"</span> \
swift build --build-path=/perfectbuild/.build_lin ${CFG}`
</pre>
</div></div></p>

<p><p>Hi, may I ask if this issue persists now? There was a region problem on EC2 which caused an missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable on the .service file but it should be corrected after a recent PA update. Please confirm your issue. Thank you.</p>

<p>Warm, </p>

<p>Rocky.</p></p>

<p><p>PA 3.0.0 has port options now; please also customize the security group for port policy as well.</p></p>
