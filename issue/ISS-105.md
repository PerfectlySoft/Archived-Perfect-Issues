# [ISS-105] Tutorial/Guide coming?

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-105.xml)
<p><p>I'm looking at the examples and none of them really help me to get started on my own project. I wondered if you are planning to release any tutorials or get started guides. Preferably on a REST API. I love that Swift is so close in performance to C++ and I would love to build my new app with this library but the learning curve seems to be too steep.</p></p>

<p><p>If someone more knowledgeable about this product could provide a tutorial outline with code samples, I'd be happy to flesh it out into a full guide. </p></p>

<p><p>I'd be for this as well. I might dig into the source this coming week.</p></p>

<p><p>I just started working in a guide in <a href="http://code-me-dirty.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/creating-perfect-swift-server.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">my blog</a> it might help you a bit. It's still work in progress. </p>

<p>For direct questions and help I would suggest to use the <a href="https://gitter.im/PerfectlySoft/Perfect" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">gitter</a> channel.</p>

<p>Cheers</p></p>

<p><p>Hi George, Aaron, Lance, and anyone else looking for this!<br/>
Alexandros's guide is great, as is Kinfey's as I am told.<br/>
We are also working on adding "Quick Start" sections to ReadMe's and creating more sample projects - as well as some nice shiny tools to help get you started easier.<br/>
For now I am going to close this issue, but please watch for announcements on the Perfect.org site, as well as Gitter and Twitter.<br/>
Thanks</p></p>
