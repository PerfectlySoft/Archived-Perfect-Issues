# [ISS-277] SQLite3 busy_timeout does't work.

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-277.xml)
<p><p>Here is the reproducing project:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ShaneQi/Busy_Timeout_Bug_Reproducing.git" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ShaneQi/Busy_Timeout_Bug_Reproducing.git</a></p>

<p>I set busy_timeout as 5 seconds and did a SELECT after an exclusive lock was acquired.</p>

<p>When it runs on my ubuntu 14.04 (sqlite 3.8.2), it works well, the SELECT sqlite connection will return code 5 (busy) after 5 seconds (busy_timeout).</p>

<p>But when it runs on macOS (sqlite 3.14.0), the SELECT sqlite connection just doesn't wait for 5 seconds. It return code 5 (busy) after less than a second.</p>

<p>Don't think it's because of different sqlite3 version, because under both env, busy_timeout works well in sqlite3 command line tool.</p></p>
