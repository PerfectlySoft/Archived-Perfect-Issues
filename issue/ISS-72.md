# [ISS-72] An ExpressJs like framework.

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-72.xml)
<p><p>Hi, I am planning on developing an ExpressJS like framework using swift. I was searching for a swift NetTCP library but could not find one. I like your NetTCP implementation, it is really neat. So, could you publish it as a separate swift package? Thanks in advance</p></p>

<p><p>I can put it together (the implementation and unit tests) in a package skeleton ready to publish if you wish.</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Youssef - take a look at the module here: <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Net" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Net</a><br/>
I think that might be what you're looking for!<br/>
Thanks</p></p>
