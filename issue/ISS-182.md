<p><p>I experience this same issue with the MySQL connector. As I am rather new to OS X and Xcode, I suspect the issue is caused by my build settings.</p>

<p>I find the entire "Perfect" project very intriguing... and would like to implement it. My thoughts, though, is to walk before I run. First, I'm looking to build a command-line project to interact with my MySQL db's. Once I've got that up and running, I'll move on to the server implementation.</p>

<p>I was once told, "Ignorance is curable... stupidity, is not". I aspire, at least, to the former... but too frequently I fall into the latter. I'll keep at it... trying to figure out why I get the duplicate loading of dynamic libraries.</p>

<p>It would be fantastic if some of the more savvy developers would give some direction to proper build settings.  <img class="emoticon" src="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p></p>

<p><p>Hi @KevinGong2013, @nt827 - it looks like you're using an old version of Perfect here (v1). We are currently focussing our efforts on Perfect 2, which works with Swift 3.</p>

<p>While I realize our docs are not updated for usage yet, I encourage you to have a look at this repo: <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MySQL</a> - also the MongoDB one, which I added a few usage notes to: <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-MongoDB</a></p>

<p>The tests in the Perfect-MySQL project may help you get things going with Perfect 2 - however please follow the steps closely in the main Perfect repo for getting your Xcode 8 and Swift 3 working correctly together.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br/>
Jono</p></p>
