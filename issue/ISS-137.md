# [ISS-137] codebeat badge

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-137.xml)
<p><p>Is it fine to add codebeat badge to README? </p>

<p>codebeat is automated code review tool for Swift, Ruby &amp; Go that helps get instant feedback on code quality. </p>

<p>"Quick wins" suggested by codebeat could be a nice candidate for a pull request and help other developers become contributors.</p>

<p>FYI. To be fully open and honest. I'm co-founder of codebeat.</p></p>

<p><p>Super! Thank you!</p>

<p>BTW... "Quick Wins" are good starting point for people who would like to start contribution to the project. It is a nice guide what to do in order to make a positive impact on overall health of the project.</p>
