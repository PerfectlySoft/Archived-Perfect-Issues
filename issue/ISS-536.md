# [ISS-536] Perfect Crypto should have a way to compute a digest without loading entire target into memory

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-536.xml)
<p><p>I'd like to calculate the md5 of a file. I don't see a good way to do this in PerfectCrypto without allocating a buffer as large as the file. CoreCrypto lets me create a digest object, and update it as needed, something similar could be needed here. Or perhaps an extension to URL which does the right thing.</p></p>
