# [ISS-169] Please can we reduce the spaces in tab from 8 to 4 or even 2 (better)

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-169.xml)
<p><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I observed that the tab is 8 characters. It makes the code a little difficult to read no matter how wide you make your editor. As we use the functional features of swift (or any other functional programming language), we will often see a lot of unavoidable nesting and thus more deeper tabs.</p>

<p>Please, can perfect team make this move to reduce the space count to 4 spaces ? I have seen 2 spaces look even better but that is my personal view. 4 spaces is most of the developers will agree I think.</p>

<p>Thanks<br/>
Kajal</p></p>

<p><p>That's odd. I only use the 4 space tabs. Do you see this problem in all the files?</p></p>

<p><p>I see them as standard 4 space tabs on 10.11.5 Beta (15F28b) running Xcode  7.3.1 (7D1012/GM Seed)</p></p>

<p><p>Hi here is an example file : <br/>
Perfect/Sources/PerfectLib/FastCGI.swift</p>

<p>Please look within github editor as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Hi <a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kajalsinha" class="user-hover" rel="kajalsinha">Kajal Sinha</a> - Looking at the current state of the source files both in the GitHub editor and Xcode 8, I am seeing tab-based spacing.</p>

<p>All I can assume is that the source formatting has been updated since raising the issue.<br/>
Thanks for bringing it to our attention!</p></p>
