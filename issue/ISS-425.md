<p><p>I'm having trouble with the push notifications, the problem seems to be inconsistent but from time to time I get an InvalidProviderToken error, then all of a sudden it works again.  I think this is related to the generation of a new token every hour and it would be nice to be able to kill off a token that was found to be invalid.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have not found a pattern yet for the invalid tokens, but I had the setup working this morning just before 10:30 ET then around 10:50 ET I was getting the InvalidProviderToken problem again and have been ever since.</p>

<p>I have tried stoping and restarting the server and generating new keys, sometimes this helps but the problem always returns.</p>

<p>Is there some way I can validate my provider token or force the server to generate a new one?</p></p>

<p><p>Yesterday we pushedÂ an update for the Notifications library which addresses this issue.</p>

<p>Can you please ensure you have version 2.1.3 of the Notifications library and that it pulled down version 1.0.5 of the PerfectCrypto library?</p></p>

<p><p>Update: I removed my SSL certificates from Keychain and from the Push Notifications section of the App Identifier in the Apple Developer Portal and generated a new certificate and I am working again.  I will keep track of my steps this time so I can try to pinpoint where it breaks.</p></p>

<p><p>Ok, after leaving the server running and untouched for the last hour and also leaving the app running and untouched, the InvalidProviderToken is back again.  It seems that the initial token is good, but all tokes generated after that one expires are not.</p></p>

<p><p>Can you please confirm the version numbers for the PerfectNotifications and PerfectCrypto packages?</p>

<p>Should be 2.1.3 and 1.0.5, respectively.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm using this in my Package.swift</p>

<p>.Package(url: "https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Notifications.git", majorVersion: 2),</p>

<p>Also, I've discovered that the tokens are fine for odd numbered hours.  It worked from 1-2, 3-4 and now 5-6 but the even numbered hours were all InvalidProviderToken</p></p>

<p><p>Open the "Packages" folder which gets created within your project's dir. You should have a series of directories in there - let me know exactly what the "PerfectNotifications-xxxxx" directory is named, specifically what the version number is. Also you should have "PerfectCrypto-xxxx". Please let me know both the versions there.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can just do a clean build to ensure you have the most recent versions. I did a push just last night and so I want to ensure we are on the same page regarding versions.</p></p>

<p><p>ok, gotcha.</p>

<p>I just did a clean and regenerate which did change my Package files.  I now have:</p>

<p>PerfectCrypto-1.0.5<br/>
PerfectNotifications-2.1.3</p>

<p>I had different versions before so this may not be an issue anymore.  Thanks for the help.</p></p>

<p><p>I've been testing off and on and have had no problems.  We can close this ticket. Thanks again.</p></p>
