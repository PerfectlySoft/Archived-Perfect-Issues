# [ISS-108] Added  func debugStringOfTuples() -> String  to PGResult.

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-108.xml)
<p><p>It is meant to be used as a convince function inside print() to help in debugging dbs.</p>

<p>I wrote this because I got tired of going to terminal to poke at the db. I figured I might as well PR and see if your interested in it. Let me know if not and I'll just close the PR.</p></p>
