# [ISS-531] PG StORM (possibly other variants) Should should probably quote field names

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-531.xml)
<p><p>Though it's generally good practice to not name a field after a reserved keyword, it happens. The SQL query generator should probably put quote marks around field names so you don't get errors like this,</p>

<p>{{ERROR:  syntax error at or near "order"<br/>
LINE 1: ...WHERE listtype = $1  AND visible = TRUE  ORDER BY order,name...<br/>
                                                             ^<br/>
