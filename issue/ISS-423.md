<p><p>I tried to use sockets using Perfect and lacking comprehensive documentation and tutorials it was long trial&amp;error experience. I managed to make connection between two running processes that communicate between themselves over socket connection, but I have a problem I don't know how to solve. </p>

<p>I read data by running this piece of code on separate thread:</p>

<p>repeat {<br/>
	self.remoteConnection.readSomeBytes(count: self.readByteCount) { bytes in<br/>
		if let bytes = bytes, bytes.count &gt; 0 </p>
{
			// do something with the data
		}
<p> else {<br/>
			if bytes == nil </p>
{
				self.connected = false
				print("server disconnected")
			}
<p>		}<br/>
	}<br/>
} while self.connected</p>

<p>this works, but it causes my process to eat all available cpu since it is looping all the time. Is there a way how to change this into blocking read that would execute only when there is actually some data to read?</p>

<p>I am sorry if this is not a proper channel to ask questions like this, if so, please let me know where to go</p></p>

<p><p>Hi, please join us on our Slack to ask such questions: <a href="http://perfect.ly/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://perfect.ly</a> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>the best reading / sending procedure on socket is using select() method, as illustration below:</p>

<p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Would you mind me asking why do you wanna use raw socket, please? </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Warm, </p>

<p>Rocky.</p></p>
