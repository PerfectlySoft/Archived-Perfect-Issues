<p><p>We bundle in a Mustache template system which you would use for this. Alternatively you could bring in your own or a 3rd party system (be it Mustache or something other).</p>

<p>The "Upload Enumerator" example project shows how to add a handler which returns a completed Mustache template to the client.</p></p>
