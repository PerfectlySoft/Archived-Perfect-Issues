<p><p>Hi <a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=monRo" class="user-hover" rel="monRo">Andrey</a> - I think this is to do with the v1 release, not the recent refactoring to v2?<br/>
Can you confirm? Closing in the meantime, please reopen if still an issue with v2. Thanks!</p></p>
