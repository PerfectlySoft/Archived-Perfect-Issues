<p><p>When I create a Perfect SMTP request and send a mail I see the mail ending like this:</p>

<p>250-mail.appelman.net<br/>
250-PIPELINING250-SIZE 125000000<br/>
250-VRFY<br/>
250-ETRN<br/>
250-STARTTLS<br/>
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES<br/>
250-8BITMIME<br/>
250 DSN<br/>
250 2.1.0 Ok<br/>
504 5.5.2 &lt;mbfred&gt;: Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname<br/>
221 2.0.0 Bye</p>

<p>It seems that Perfect SMTP has no option to set the FQH. I also looked at the underlying Perfect CURL which I believe is used for the delivery and it also seems to be lacking that option. </p>

<p>How can I fix this. </p>

<p>Note that this probably depends on the current DCHP settings; If possible I would like to make this more robust.</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for using Perfect. May I ask if you were trying to apply an SMTPS on your own SMTP server with a self-assigned domain name? Perfect-SMTP is using CURL to perform the session so please note that this would violate the SMTPS protocol.</p>

<p>On your testing server, I would suggest to either use smtp:// to replace smtps:// or apply another self-signed certificate to CURL system, i.e, the best practice shall be to use curl to test it first before coding. </p>

<p>Please note that is <b>not</b> your <b>Perfect-SMTP</b> <b>client</b> to apply this setting or not, or have any "robust" APIs to cheat TLS/SSL, it is really up to your <b>mail server configuration</b> (You are using Postfix, aren't you? Please double check the postfix setting for the hostname if so)<b>.</b> <br/>
Besides, all mail addresses should be valid FQDN, too.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you would probably to register a domain name and get the proper certificate for your mail server, since Perfect-SMTP has been tested on lots of famous servers such as google mail, GMX, etc., by a large number of end users.</p>

<p>Please join our slack <a href="http://perfect.ly/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://perfect.ly</a> to get instant feedbacks.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p><p>No, I am not using SMTPS. This is a regular SMTP. </p>

<p>Yes I am controlling the mail server and it is demanding a fully qualified hostname for the sender. Normally if you have a server side app that should not be a problem. As said I would like to know if I somehow can set the FQH name.</p></p>

<p><p>can you please use this command line tool to verify your client settings?</p>

<p>Perfect-SMTP will no exceed this range.</p></p>

<p><p>Just checked and this works without problems. The failure happens on my laptop when I am work so I would like to check this one more time tomorrow when I'm in the office. </p>

<p>On that page I also noticed that you can apparently sent the sending host name in the SMTP url. </p>

<p>To instead have curl send client.example.com in the HELO / EHLO command<br/>
to the mail server at mail.example.com, use:</p>

<p>```<br/>
curl smtp://mail.example.com/client.example.com<br/>
```</p>

<p>I will test that as well.</p></p>

<p><p>Ok, I am now back in the office and can tell you the following:</p>

<p>1. Curl on the command line just works. I can send the example text file without any issues.<br/>
2. If I try my application again it fails.<br/>
3. If I now adjust the smtp URI for the application it does work as well. </p>

<p>So concluding, I can influence the HELO handshake by configuring the second part of the SMTP uri. </p>

<p>Please consider this closed.</p></p>
