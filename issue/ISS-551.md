# [ISS-551] Perfect-Redis:  Large bulk string responses blow up with a bad access exception

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-551.xml)
<p><p>I have an LRANGE with 504 string elements (in JSON format) that Perfect-Redis seems to choke on with a bad access exception.  The initial parsing seems fine and also seems to work on small sets, but at sufficient size, I get ~707 frames of backtrace depth and a subsequent crash.  In some cases, I have observed data corruption on large data sets as well.  I've attached a screen shot of the backtrace depth, as well as the exception.  I've isolated the problem consistently, so I've also got a git repo with the code I used to replicate the problem:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ptumati/PerfectRedisBugReplicator.git" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ptumati/PerfectRedisBugReplicator.git</a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>To replicate the problem, create a list with 600 or 700 rows with a string that looks like the one that returns from this LRANGE command:</p>

<p> </p>
<div class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<pre>127.0.0.1:6379&gt; LRANGE FatBotSimPendingQueue_CRASH 0 10
 1) "{\"binary\":\"FatBotSim\",\"date\":\"20170912\",\"parameters\":[\"--symbol=PG\",\"--db=20170912_PG\",\"--date=20170912\",\"--preset=0\",\"--outliermode=0\"]}"
 
</pre>
</div></div>
<p> </p>

<p>Then perform an LRANGE operation like in the sample code in the git repo.  You will get a crash as identified by the screenshots I attached in PerfectRedis.swift – line 152, in the bulkString case.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><p>Hi Pavan, could you please confirm if the issue persists after merging your PR?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis/pull/7/files" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-Redis/pull/7/files</a></p>

<p>Thank you.</p></p>

<p><p>The issue persists.  My PR enabled the json strings to be sent as values, and the system works for small amounts of data.  However, when I tried to blast the system with huge JSON strings, it blew up.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I sent Kyle Jessup an invite to the private repo with the code that creates the issue for your testing purposes.</p>

<p><p>(Note, I migrated away from this redis driver and have not been keeping my fork up to date – so if there has been further work on this I have not been tracking it.)</p>

<p> </p></p>
