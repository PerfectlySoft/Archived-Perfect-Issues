<p><p>In Perfect-PostgresSQL, parts of the database result or connection metadata seem to stay in memory even after calling result.clear() and connection.finish(). This leads to problems when running many subsequent database queries, as more and more memory gets allocated.</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Daniel,Â <br/>
I've tested the case but found no leaks at all.</p>

<p>Please feel free to check the testing script branch here:</p>


<p><a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL/pull/16/files" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect-PostgreSQL/pull/16/files</a></p>

<p>This script is fetching large records for many times, but my observation shows that the memory went stable after an increase in the first few loops - it might be just caching.</p>



<p>You can try it yourself in Xcode instrument/profiling tools to reproduce the outcome from my script.</p>



<p>Please note that if using OS X, an `autoreleasepool` may be helpful in loops, which will actually release cached resources that may seem to be a leak.</p>



<p>Rocky.</p></p>
