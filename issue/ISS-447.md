<p><p>The system I evaluate, the benchmark I do is something like that</p>

<p> TestHarnessRequester  &lt;-<del>&gt; PerfectEngine  &lt;</del>-&gt; Server</p>

<p>TestHarnessRequester is a simple C application made with Mongoose which send request under a REST API call, Get and POST ones</p>

<p>PerfectEngine for now is just like a proxy, receive request from the requester send them to the Server and then send back the result to the requester if any.</p>

<p>Server is an old C server, mono threaded, which do heavy process on data in a real time manner.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of what I evaluate is the capability for the engine to feed up the Server with enough request to keep it busy. </p>

<p>When I connect directly the requester to the server I keep the server busy at 99% of a core CPU... <br/>
When I use the Perfect engine in between I have some difficulty to get it consuming 7/8 % of the core CPU</p>

<p>To give you an idea, I do a bench with Akka-Http library and succeed in the same scenario to feed at 91% of a core CPU... </p>

<p>An other measure I look at is the CPU consumed by the clients</p>

<p>Requester ~ 0.7 %<br/>
Akka Engine ~ 8 --&gt; 20 % (java very a lot here, I have to investigate why)<br/>
PerfectEngine ~ 20%</p>

<p>Seems to me very strange, very bad </p>

<p>Context of my tests : MacBook Pro 2015 2.5 Ghz, 16 gigas of RAM<br/>
Binaries in release mode</p>
