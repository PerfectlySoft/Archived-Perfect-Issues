# [ISS-270] Custom logging facility for production use

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-270.xml)
<p><p>Logging in swift is rather limited currently for release builds as ASL isn't used. Is there a plan / way to modify the logging across all modules so printing can be redirected through a custom utility or at minimum to a file?</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Wain,</p>

<p>Yes, there are plans to bring both third party and others, to the framework. <br/>
In the meantime if you do something along these lines please let us know and we will make sure it gets included in a directory of 3rd party contributions!</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>â€“ Jonathan Guthrie</p></p>
