# [ISS-532] A mistake in the documentation

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-532.xml)
<p><p>In the documentation of threading in the address: <a href="http://example.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://perfect.org/docs/thread.html</a> where the strategy of threading events is outlined, it is mentioned that after acquiring lock, a consumer should check if any resource is available to consume or calls <ins>wait()</ins> otherwise.</p>

<p>Here is the problem:</p>

<p>Imagine there is a blocked consumer thread which called wait() on itself. Producer creates a resource, calls <ins>signal()</ins> and releases the lock. another new incoming thread grabs the lock and consumes the newly created resource while the blocked thread receives signal and starts working in the hope of accessing a resource which doesn't exist anymore. </p></p>

<p><p>Please note that threading is using a queue to lock/wait, so generally, it is not necessary to worry about it unless intensively disordering the queue.</p></p>
