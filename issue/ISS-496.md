# [ISS-496] How to add unit tests?

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-496.xml)
<p><p>Hi, I'm trying to add unit tests to my project but it seems that the main target can't be selected as test target.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>What am I missing? Is there some example project with tests?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Mario.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm assuming you're using the Swift Package Manager?</p>

<p>If so*, executable targets can't be tested, only libraries. The workaround I'm using is as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create two subfolders (Sources/&lt;executable name&gt; and Sources/&lt;core library name&gt;)</li>
	<li>Move your existing codebase into the &lt;core library name&gt; folder</li>
	<li>Put a single file in the &lt;executable name&gt; folder that just calls the entry point to your main code.</li>
	<li>Target the library when doing your tests!</li>
</ol>


<p>It really is that easy. If you need more detailed help, feel free to contact me on Slack (@thislooksfun)</p>

<p>*) If you're not going through SPM it's the same problem, but I don't know the exact steps to fix it.</p></p>
