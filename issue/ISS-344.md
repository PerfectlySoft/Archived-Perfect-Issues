<p><p>Just started with Perfect-*,  so I could be doing something wrong. Working on a existing database, where I saw that a column:</p>

<p>file varchar(250) NOT NULL </p>

<p>was returned as Optional("/etc/bind")</p>

<p>I would have thought that this should have been a non-optional value? </p></p>

<p><p>Hi Dennis Schafroth,</p>

<p>Thank you for this very question.</p>

<p>Swift non-nil variable is different to SQL NOT NULL concept. In swift coding, there are actually quite a few processes, including system api to DB api, to bring actual data value into a real swift objects, so yes, it has been defined as optional string instead.</p>

<p>Hope to enjoy it and Good luck.</p>

<p>Warm,</p>
