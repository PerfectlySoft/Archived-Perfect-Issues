# [ISS-339] Perfect Assistant Apply Xcode UI Behavior Patterns To Missing Directories

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-339.xml)
<p><p>As a user of Perfect Assistant, I would like to have some indication that the project directory that Perfect Assistant is keeping track of has had it's actual filesystem deleted. </p>

<p>Currently in Xcode, if one selects a folder reference in the project tree and delete it via Finder, rm -rf etc the label text color for the folder turns red. If one then selects that folder item and presses the Delete key, that now defunct folder </p>

<p>Proposed acceptance criteria</p>

<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li>The project name label in the sidebar has red text after the user deletes the corresponding project directory.</li>
	<li>Selecting the project entry in the Perfect Assistant sidebar and hitting the "Delete" key removes that project from the list of projects in the sidebar.</li>
</ul>


<ul class="alternate" type="square">
	<li></li>
</ul>
</p>
