<p><p>Yes it's 100% suited to working as a chat server - the most recent that was done was a websockets version.</p>

<p>I will see if we are ok to publish that. Will leave the thread open for now and update soon.</p></p>

<p><p>You might need to leverage a lower level TCP connection to do this. There's a web sockets example repo if that helps?<br/>
