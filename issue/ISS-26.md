<p><p>Just to confirm, the steps you refer to include creating a .pc file or symlinking to the existing .pc file in your MySql installation ? If the .pc file is there per instructions, I would double check that it has the same permissions as its neighbors, and verify that the paths point to a valid location.</p>

<p>I have not used beta3 yet based on issues reported with the swift Language version settings conflicting with auto generated project files, but typically the library not found indicates a missing or misconfigured package config file.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p><p>Sorry, I meant to write beta 2. I have removed <tt>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</tt> from the mysqlclient.pc file after mysql installation. Permissions seem to fine</p>

<p><tt>lrwxr-xr-x  1 MyUser  wheel   54 Jul 20 15:54 mysqlclient.pc -&gt; ../../Cellar/mysql/5.7.13/lib/pkgconfig/mysqlclient.pc</tt></p></p>

<p><p>Ok, It worked somehow after reinstalling <tt>mysql</tt> and re-generating the project with <tt>swift package generate-xcodeproj</tt>.</p></p>
