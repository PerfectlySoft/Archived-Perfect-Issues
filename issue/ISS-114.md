# [ISS-114] PerfectLib: Readme.md does not list dependency on libicu-dev.

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-114.xml)
<p><p>I was following the Linux Build Notes for PerfectLib in the Readme.md, and was failing to make with an error. To fix it I installed libicu-dev. I recommend that libicu-dev is added to the dependencies listed in the Readme.md</p></p>
