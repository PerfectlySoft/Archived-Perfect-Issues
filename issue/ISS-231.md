# [ISS-231] PerfectNet ff0aaec6 Breaks Swift 2016-06-20

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-231.xml)
<p><p>The most up-to-date deployment options are using Swift 2016-06-20.  Commit ff0aaec6 for PerfectNet is incompatible with Swift 2016-06-20, so the PerfectTemplate project won't build with it.  In particular, the removal of "where":</p>

<p>/usr/src/PerfectTemplate/Packages/PerfectNet-0.18.0/Sources/NetTCPSSL.swift:186:30: error: boolean condition requires 'where' to separate it from variable binding<br/>
                if let sslCtx = self.sslCtx, self.sharedSSLCtx == false {<br/>
                                           ^<br/>

<p><p>Hi Shao,</p>

<p>The codebase has just been updated to use the July 25, 2016 snapshots...<br/>

<p>Sorry, should have been communicated to you!</p>

<p>One of the changes was in fact the removal of the where and replaced with a comma, as you see!</p>

<p><p>Ok, a challenge we have is that I've already spent more than 20 hours developing 11 of the 2016-06-20 deployment options and I am documented those options.  I shouldn't document them if they don't work.  Can we move July 25th stuff to its own branches, or do we need to redevelop all 11 options?</p></p>
