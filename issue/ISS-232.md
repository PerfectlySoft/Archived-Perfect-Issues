# [ISS-232] Using Master Branches with Older Swifts

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-232.xml)
<p><p>So far, I've encountered 3 different dependencies for PerfectTemplate which no longer work with the Swift 2016-06-20 that's present in our most up-to-date deployment options.  How do we ensure that the documentation leads developers to get a version of the PerfectTemplate project that pulls in dependencies whose versions are compatible with Swift 2016-06-20?</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Shao,</p>

<p>Linked this to <a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/browse/ISS-231" title="PerfectNet ff0aaec6 Breaks Swift 2016-06-20" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="ISS-231"><del>ISS-231</del></a> as it's the same thing. The snapshots just got updated.</p>

<p>The 27th is the date where Swift 3.0 is "breaking code frozen" so we should start to see a decrease in the mess that these changes are creating.</p>
