# [ISS-217] Slow response time

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-217.xml)
<p><p>Just getting started with Perfect but immediately noticed the response times on localhost were slow, around 5 seconds. </p>

<p>Digging around I noticed <tt>oldCompletion</tt> was not getting called after the handling was complete. <br/>
This line here: <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect/blob/master/Sources/PerfectLib/HTTPServer.swift#L275" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect/blob/master/Sources/PerfectLib/HTTPServer.swift#L275</a></p>

<p>I replaced that with the contents of that block <tt>request.connection.close()</tt> and request times are back down to the expected (near instant ��)</p>

<p>Am I missing something or is this an issue in the lib?</p></p>

<p><p>Yes! This has been fixed in master but hasn't been tagged yet. It's a regression after refactoring and shifting around the HTTP request response objects. Response is not setting the content-length properly. I'm trying to track down another issue when serving large files through byte ranges, after which I will tag this fix. Good catch, thank you.</p></p>
