<p><p>Please reconsider the terms for the client code. It makes all the client apps open-sourced.  I cannot accept that.</p></p>

<p><p>We are working on further clarification, in detail. For the time being, I've merged this request with the ongoing dialogue in <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect/issues/26" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect/issues/26</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input! We will address the clarification. (Client apps do NOT need to be open source).</p></p>

<p><p>Thanks for the feedback, it was helpful. We've switched to Apache, and your request was part of this decision. Happy coding!</p>
