<p><p>To expand a little, say for example that you wanted to test Perfect in a production environment, serving a webpage with a hostname on port 80. If you configure the server to the correct public IP and Hostname, then run Perfect, you get a network error similar to "Exception in server run loop NetworkError(13, "Permission denied") 0.0.0.0:80"</p>

<p>If you edit your scheme and debug as root, this resolves the error with port 80 (only root is allowed to bind port numbers below 1024), but the content is not longer served, as the runRequest always returns a 404 status code with "The file "/" was not found." on the screen. </p></p>

<p><p>This issue is resolved with the latest builds on Swift 3 (swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-06-06-a)</p></p>
