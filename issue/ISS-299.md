# [ISS-299] fileError(2, "No such file or directory .......... File.swift open(_:permissions:) 232")

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-299.xml)
<p><p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm getting the above error when I run the Mustache Blog example via XCode (in debugging) if i run the server manually via Terminal (locally on my Mac) it runs fine...... but if I upload the project to my Ubuntu instance and run the sever - I again get the above error......</p>

<p>My guess is permissions maybe, but any pointers would be much appreciated...</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Chris</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Chris Barker,</p>

<p>Hi Chris - you need to set the working directory in the project's schema. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
BTW, you will get more direct assistance with this sort of thing on the Slack channel.<br/>

<p><p>Thanks Jonathan, thanks for the reply</p>

<p>I've tried that but it's still the same (i pointed the working directory to the projects directory).<br/>
Something tells me this might run a little deeper as I get this when starting the application on my Ubuntu instance (which i dont believe would read my xcode project settings) - or am i mistaken?</p>

<p>If you prefer, i'll head over to the Slack groups for this one.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance</p>

<p>Chris</p></p>
