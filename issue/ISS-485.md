<p><p>Hi there,</p>

<p>You do great work here ! I'm new to perfect, and think it has a future.</p>

<p>For now, I can't build perfectnet on linux. I have this error.</p>

<p>----------------------------------</p>

<p>Compile Swift Module 'PerfectNet' (7 sources)<br/>
/perfectbuild/Packages/PerfectNet-2.1.12/Sources/NetTCPSSL.swift:688:40: error: value of optional type 'UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;?.Type?' not unwrapped; did you mean to use '!' or '?'?</p>

<p>return outBuf.withMemoryRebound(to: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;?.self, capacity: 1)</p>

<p>----------------------------------</p>

<p>I've tried to path by adding a force cast when building on linux, and it seems to work.</p>

<p>About this little fix, I'm not very used to the open source ways, and have some questions.</p>

<p>This is what i've done :<br/>
• I have forked perfectHTTPServer, perfectHTTP and perfectNet<br/>
• then I've changed the package file to point to my perfectHTTPServer repository.<br/>
• Finally I've changed the perfectHTTP package file to point to my perfectNet version, thinking it would then install my forked versions of the 3 packages</p>

<p>But when I want to deploy, perfectHTTP and perfectNet are still downloaded from your repo... only my forked version of HTTPServer is installed.</p>

<p>So I can't deploy with my perfectNet patch.. How to deal with such situations ?</p>

<p>Thanks by advance,</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Tristan</p></p>

<p><p>Hi Tristan, </p>

<p>Thanks for choosing Perfect. May I ask the version of your Linux, please? Currently the only stable version that Perfect runs well is Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The best practice is using <a href="http://www.perfect.org/en/perfect-assistant.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Perfect Assistant 2.0</a> to build Linux App on Mac, however, you can directly `git clone <a href="https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate.git" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate.git</a>` and perform a `swift build` to see if everything works fine. It is an HTTP server starter and you don't have to know much about the components inside of Package.swift, actually.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If need help, please join us on Slack <a href="http://perfect.ly/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://perfect.ly</a> and get instant feedback other than raise an issue.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Warm,</p>

<p>Rocky.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p></p>
