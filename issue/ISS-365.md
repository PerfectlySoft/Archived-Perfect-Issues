<p><p>Joomla, Wordpress and Laravel have define certain group of privilege can access restricted routes e.g. Admin, Public, Moderator</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this has been requested before. Probably, a #1 feature we all consider for writing custom CMS. A simple privilege system will be sufficient and Vapor has this "group" feature. It should be fine to develop our own permission table in database if there is no plan to develop for Perfect,</p></p>

<p><p>Hi James,</p>

<p>Agreed, very necessary.<br/>
I'm planning a new, more comprehensive version that should include users and groups...</p>
