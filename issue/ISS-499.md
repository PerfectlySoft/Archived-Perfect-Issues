# [ISS-499] Slash at the end of route URI is ignored

[XML Source](./xml/ISS-499.xml)
<p><p>We have some infra written Perfect.org about 4 months ago. Today I updated it and found that it is totally broken as slashes at the end of route URI are ignored.</p>

<p><span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:handler&#93;</span>,<br/>
<span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/test/&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:handler&#93;</span>,</p>

<p>curl "http://localhost:8181/test" -&gt; HTTP 200<br/>
curl "http://localhost:8181/test/" -&gt; HTTP 404</p>

<p>In our case we can't drop slashes at the end as we migrated from wordpress and link to our site are everywhere across the internet. </p>

<p><p>Fix tagged as 2.2.4.</p></p>

<p><p>I'm afraid it still reproduces. Looks like HTTPRequest.pathComponents != String.routePathComponents</p></p>

<p><p>Should be fixed with PerfectHTTPServer tagged as 2.3.1.</p>

<p>Will close issue after confirmation this time.</p>

<p> </p></p>

<p><p>I just updated my PerfectHTTPServer to 2.3.1: it still has this problem. "/test" works. "/test/" says "The file /test/index.html was not found."</p></p>

<p><p>Note: if I add a "test" route uri AND a "test/" route uri, then the routing works fine. That's at least a workaround, but should we have to do that?</p></p>


### Tue, 1 Aug 2017 14:46:15 -0400 / vitalii 

<p><p>Yes, I can reproduce it as well </p></p>

<p><p>My results with the test project attached to this issue are:</p>

<p> </p>

<p>/ = Hello, world!</p>

<p>/test/ = Hello, world!</p>

<p>/test = The file /test was not found.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Those look like the right answers to me. /test falls through to the static file handler.</p>

<p><tt>"routes":[</tt><tt><span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:handler&#93;</span>,</tt></p>

<p><tt><span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/test/&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:handler&#93;</span>,</tt><tt><span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/**&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:PerfectHTTPServer.HTTPHandler.staticFiles,}}{{&quot;documentRoot&quot;:&quot;./webroot&quot;,}}{{&quot;allowResponseFilters&quot;:true&#93;</span></tt><tt>]</tt></p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you are getting different results with that project can you please remove the Package.pins file and do a `</p>

<p>swift package reset ; swift build` and test again?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you are triggering the problem with a different set of routes please post them so I can try it out.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks!</p></p>

<p><p>Before I test your project, @Kyle Jessup, a comment: I've taken a quick look at the HTTP specs (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6)." class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6).</a> It appears there's not really a standard for whether the slash returns the same result. (Section 6.2.4 discusses web-crawler attention to URIs with an ending slash and not.)</p>

<p>If I'm understanding correctly that there's no standard regarding the trailing slash, then Perfect is behaving as expected: we need to code routes for both "test" and "test/" if we want them to go to the same place.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><tt>"routes":[</tt><tt><span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/test&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:handler&#93;</span>,</tt></p>

<p><tt><span class="error">&#91;&quot;method&quot;:&quot;get&quot;, &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;/test/&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;:handler&#93;</span>, ...</tt></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p> </p></p>

<p><p>Yes, swift  package reset helped, now I can see it works. Thanks!</p></p>


### Wed, 2 Aug 2017 09:30:16 -0400 / leanne 

<p><p>Yeah, I was looking at this from a different perspective. It's totally working fine since your fix. Thanks, Kyle, for your hard work!</p></p>


### Wed, 2 Aug 2017 09:46:31 -0400 / kjessup 

<p><p>@LeAnne your point is a good one and I can see some people wanting things one way while others prefer another. My main concern was that the behaviour changed inadvertently as a side-effect of adding further features and I want to ensure it's consistent and the people working code doesn't break <img class="emoticon" src="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></p>

<p> </p>

<p>That said, it looks like things are back to how they were so I'll go ahead and close this. If you see anything further here please add a comment and I'll reopen or investigate.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thanks!</p></p>
