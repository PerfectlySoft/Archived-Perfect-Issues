# [ISS-106] [WIP] remove self

[XML Source](../xml/ISS-106.xml)
<p><p>This is a huge change and should be tested and reviewed quite a bit. I did run all the tests there are and all the one that are passing on mast are also passing after this change. (The ones that are failing on master I think are mainly test bugs and not tested code bugs.)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell I have removed all self. that could be removed and left necessary ones. I am going to let it sit for a few days and come back with fresh eyes to see if I can catch any mistakes. </p>

<p>Comments very welcome!</p>
