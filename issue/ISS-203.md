                                                var filter = Filter.None<br/>
                                                             ^<del>~</del> ~~~~</p>

<p><p>Am seeing this Filter enum dont have "None". <br/>
enum Filter {<br/>
		case none, error(Int32), read, write, timer</p></p>

<p><p>hmm, and the lowercase looks consistent… <br/>
good find.</p>

<p>Can you confirm that changing the code in NetEvent.swift to lowercase the Filter member fixes the issue? I would assume that is where it will need to be fixed.</p>

<p><p><a href="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=taplin" class="user-hover" rel="taplin">Tim Taplin</a> what do you mean by confirmation. Honestly, If someone already working with Perfectly swift project confirm it would be better. I just started today, good day <img class="emoticon" src="http://jira.perfect.org:8080/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> </p></p>

<p><p>We are trying to take care of making our APIs conform to the Swift API guidelines before our next official release, which should correspond with Swift 3.0's release. As such, all enum values were changed to be lower case.</p>

<p>If you are seeing weird issues with compiling the Net, Thread or PerfectLibs, try a <tt>swift build --clean=dist</tt> and then try building again to see if simply fetching the most up-to-date versions does not fix the problem in the libs, noting that you may still have to update your code to match.</p>

<p>Our goal is to get all such breaking changes out of the way now so that we can have smoother updates post Swift 3.0.</p></p>

<p><p>This is fixed now on all platforms. I get proper builds on OS X, U15 &amp; U14.</p></p>
